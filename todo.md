## To do

- Build out basic level 1
- Add collision detection
- Add basic physics
  - gravity
  - run (on input)
  - jump (on input)
- Trigger run animation frames
- Design and connect player jump and idle animation frames
- Collectibles - should they track across levels, prevent level doors etc or should they be more like coins where there's no real benefit to collecting them all (or should there be lives?). Should collectibles be a challenge to collect?
- Add basic jump sound effect (randomly trigger silly jump sound)
- Music

### Stretch goals

- Level end sound effect
- Redesign the sprites (make them nicer)
- Level 2
- Refine jump sound effect (juh moving off ground; uhh when in air; mp when reaching the ground) - state machine
- Custom collision assets
- Custom decorative assets

## Started

- Main menu
- Level 1
- Custom player sprite with run animation frames

## Done

- Add placeholder level assets from kenney.nl
